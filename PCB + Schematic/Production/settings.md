# PCBWay Production Settings
This is a compilation of the settings that I use for PCBWay fabrication.
| PCBWay Option | My setting |
|---------------|------------|
| Assembly Side | Top Side   |
| Impedance control | Yes |
| Board thickness | 0.8mm |
| Board Color | Red |
| Components | Turnkey |

*Note*: The board quantity is separate from the assembly quantity. The assembly quantity designates how many of the board quantity is actually populated, and component cost will increase accordingly.

*Note*: The included BOM does not include the Keystone 53 battery holders for the back side. You will have to order this component from external suppliers like Digikey or Mouser.

*Note*: The board comes with JLink SWD headers on the back side. This is designed to work with the [Adafruit 4048 SWD connectors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4048). You will also **need** a JLink programmer to program the bootloader. Information on this can be found by submitting an issue.
